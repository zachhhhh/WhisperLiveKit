📄 SimulStreaming (https://github.com/ufal/SimulStreaming) Licence

SimulStreaming is dual-licensed:

🔹 Non-Commercial Use

You may use SimulStreaming under the **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0** if you
obtain the code through the GitHub repository.  This license is **free of charge**
and comes with **no obligations** for non-commercial users.

🔸 Commercial Use

Understanding who uses SimulStreaming commercially helps us improve and
prioritize development. Therefore, we want to **require registration** of those who acquire a commercial licence.

We plan to make the commercial licenceses **affordable** to SMEs and individuals. We
are considering to provide commercial licenses either for free or for symbolic
one-time fee, and maybe also provide additional support. You can share your preference via the [questionnaire](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/7tCxb4gJfB).

You can also leave your contact [there](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/7tCxb4gJfB) to be notified when the commercial licenses become
available.
